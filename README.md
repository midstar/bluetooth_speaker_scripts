# Bluetooth speaker scripts Home Assistant

Scripts for connecting, disconnecting, check connection
status and play audo to a bluetooth speaker.

I wrote the scripts so that they can be used from Home
Assistant.

# System requirements

The scripts use BlueAlsa and NOT PulseAudio. I tried to
use PulseAudio and I have described my experience with
this tool further down. 

I'm currently using Armbian 20.08.07 Buster on a BananaPi 
SBC, but all hardware platforms (PC, RaspberryPi, OrangePi,
ROCK64 etc.) running a modern Linux should work.

Install the required packages:

    sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluealsa

Some platforms, including mine, did not have bluealsa as a 
ready package. Therefore you need to build it as described
[here](https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa).

Also, you need to install bluealsa as a system service.
Copy the [bluealsa.service](bluealsa.service) to:

    /etc/systemd/system/bluealsa.service

And run:

    sudo systemctl enable bluealsa
    sudo systemctl start bluealsa

You also need bluetooth integrated on your board or use a 
bluetooth USB stick.

The speaker needs to support A2DP profile over Bluetooth 
(which is almost always the case for all bluetooth speakers).

# Run

To connect to the Bluetooth speaker run:

    sh connect.sh <MAC>

Where MAC is in the format XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.

To just check if the Bluetooth speaker is connected and audio 
is routed to it. Then run:

    sh is_connected.sh <MAC>

The script will return "Connected" or "Disconnected"

To play audio over the Bluetooth speaker, and as a backup,
play over the standard audio output (for example AUX):

    sh play.sh <audio file> <MAC>

The MAC argument is optional. You can also write the MAC
address to following file that needs to be in the same
location as the scripts:

    speaker_mac.conf 

# Why not use pulsealsa?

I tried to get Bluetooth using pulsealsa but did not manage
to be able to get A2DP to work when running pulsealsa in 
service mode, i.e. as a daemon. 

Running in user mode was not an option either, because when
Home Assistant is started, there is no user session and thus
pulsealsa won't start. A workround is to login a user session
separately, using the same user as home assistant, but this
user session will eventually time out. In my case the timeout
was 2 hours (of inactivity) and after this point pulsealsa
will be deactivated.

There are some scripts for pulseaudio [here](pulseaudio/README.md),
but they will not work.

Only blueaudio seems to be stable to run as a service process.

# Troubleshooting

If the speaker connects and disconnects immediatly after it might
be that you need to restart bluealsa:

    sudo systemctl restart bluealsa

# Run from Home Assistant

Personally I'm using the script to connect to the bluetooth speaker and to play
audio, such as a doorbell sound, when someone hits my ZigBee button which I
have at my front door.

Add following rows to configuration.yaml

    shell_command:
      connect_bluetooth_speaker: sh /home/myusername/.homeassistant/bluetooth_speaker_scripts/connect.sh 11:22:33:44:55:66

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: command_line
      command: 'sh /home/myusername/.homeassistant/bluetooth_speaker_scripts/is_connected.sh 11:22:33:44:55:66'
      name: 'Bluetooth Speaker'
      payload_on: 'Connected'
      payload_off: 'Disconnected'

Now we have created a service that we can call from Home Assistant:

- shell\_command.connect\_bluetooth\_speaker

You also have the binary sensor:

- binary\_sensor.bluetooth\_speaker

To automatically connect to Bluetooth speaker when it is disconneted
add an automation:

- Trigger: time\_pattern, every minute (/1)
- Condition: State, binary\_sensor.bluetooth\_speaker, state: 'off'
- Action: run service shell\_command.connect\_bluetooth\_speaker
